Mao Shan Wang AKA: Butter durian, Cat Mountain King, Rajah Kunyit.

Probably the most popular type of durian among Singaporeans besides the D24. Rich in taste and color, Mao Shan Wang durians boast a creamy texture and leave a strong bittersweet taste in your mouth.

To distinguish them, look out for the pyramid-shapes thorns at the base of the stem. They also have a unique starfish-shaped pattern found at the base of the durian fruit.
