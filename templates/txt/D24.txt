Before the Mao Shan Wang breed surged in popularity, the most famous breed back in the ’90s was the D24 durians. D24 durians are a little less overwhelming in flavour and are known for their creamy texture and subtle bittersweet after-taste. If you’re not that familiar with durians, this is a good introduction to the king of fruits.

The stem of the durian is shorter compared to other durians and it has a brown-coloured ring around the bottom of the stem.
